# Cattle Corral Optimization Algorithm (CCO)
## A Novel, Meta Heuristic, Nature Inspired, Feature Selection Algorithm

## Overview

Machine learning optimization often involves complex challenges like large search spaces and hyperparameter sensitivity, especially in domains like fake news detection. Nature-inspired metaheuristics (e.g., PSO, WOA) have emerged as powerful tools to address these issues.

This repository presents the **Cattle Corral Optimization (CCO)** algorithm, a novel metaheuristic building upon this field. CCO is inspired by the ecosystem around grazing cattle, translating animal behaviors into optimization strategies.

## How CCO Works

CCO uses a two-pronged search mechanism:

1.  **Egret-Inspired Global Search:** Mimics the strategic movement of egrets towards resource-rich areas (high-potential solutions).
2.  **Fly-Inspired Local Search:** Simulates the random, localized exploration of flies around cattle (refining known good solutions).

These behaviors are integrated within a population-based model designed for machine learning pipelines.

## Core Functionality & Features

*   **Hybrid Optimization:** Simultaneously optimizes model hyperparameters and selects informative feature subsets.
*   **Informed Initialization:** Uses pre-ranked features (weighted correlation & mutual information) to guide the initial search, improving convergence speed and solution quality.
*   **Efficiency:** Employs an early stopping mechanism based on fitness stagnation to avoid unnecessary computation.

## Repository Purpose

This repository provides the source code for the CCO algorithm, enabling its use and further development. 

**Key Contributions:**
*   Novel CCO Algorithm blending global (egret) and local (fly) search.
*   Hybrid feature selection and hyperparameter tuning framework.
*   Empirical validation demonstrating effectiveness.
